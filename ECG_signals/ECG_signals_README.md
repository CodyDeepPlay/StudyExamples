# "ECG_signal" folder contains various examples of ECG signal processing and predictions. 

* It might contain .py files or .ipynb files. 

## "qt-database-1.0.0.zip" 
* This zip file contains some ECG data sets downloaded from Physionet data base, 			 https://www.physionet.org/content/qtdb/1.0.0/
  It contains information about EMG annotation, segmentation, classification, etc.

## "ECG_data_annatation.ipynb" 
* This file shows how to prepare the data from Physionet data base, and organize it with ECG raw data and its corresponding annotation.
 
## "ECG_segmentation.py" 
* This file shows an example of how to use an lstm based deep learning framwork to conduct ECG signal annotation. 
folder 'lstm_seg_raw20200710-1533' contrained a pre-trained model, this is a lstm based simple deep learning model.
One can use the pre-trained model to conduct ECG segmentation.
