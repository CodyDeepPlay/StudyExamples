# This repository is used to store various study example in python. 

It might contain .py files or .ipynb files. 


## "CreateTFLiteModel" folder
* This folder has study example and note of using tensorflow lite. It is related how some machine learning model can be implemented on a microcontroller. 
 

## "ECG_signal" folder
* This folder contains some ECG data sets downloaded from Physionet data base, https://www.physionet.org/content/qtdb/1.0.0/
  This folder also have my study files about EMG annotation, segmentation, classification. 
 
 
## "PandasDataFrame" folder
* Things about Pandas dataframe. 


## "ReproduceScipyFilterings" folder
* Detailed walk through how to reproduce Scipy.signal's filtering function. 


## "Regression" folder 
* This folder contains simple examples of regression using machine learning algorithms.


## "Useful_python_examples" folder
* This folder contains other useful python example.
	Could have python tikinter GUI simple example, read csv file, etc.  
 
 
## "hmmmodel.dill" file 
* this file is hmm model trained from the "HMM_ECG_example.py" file. It can be used next time to conduct the prediction, instead of train the data again.
